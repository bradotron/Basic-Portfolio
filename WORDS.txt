                Hello everyone! My name is Bradley Jensen and I’m an engineer and
                aspiring web developer. I’m currently living in Washington DC, which
                is a great place to live and work. I enjoy building things.
                Everything from a meal I’ve never tried cooking to
                Internet-of-Things projects. The learning process and solving
                problems are my passion.

                I’m building a portfolio of web development projects. Focusing
                on a fluid user experience with quick and responsive backend
                systems. Experienced with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; including the
                Bootstrap libraries.

                My educational background is a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from
                Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo and a Masters in Engineering Management
                from Ohio University. This education served me well during my tenure
                as an Electronics Warfare Test Engineer at Edwards, AFB. And I am
                currently a Senior Engineer at Modern Technology Solutions, Inc.
                providing contract support to the Developmental and Operational Test
                Teams at the F-35 Joint Program Office.
