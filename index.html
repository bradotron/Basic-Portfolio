          Hello everyone! My name is Bradley Jensen and I’m an engineer and
          aspiring web developer. I’m currently living in Washington DC, which
          is a great place to live and work. I enjoy building things. Everything
          from a meal I’ve never tried cooking to Internet-of-Things projects.
          The learning process and solving problems are my passion.
        </p>

        <p class="over-img">
          I’m building a solid portfolio of web development projects. Focusing
          on a fluid user experience with quick and responsive backend systems.
          Experienced with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; including the Bootstrap
          libraries.
        </p>

        <p class="over-img">
          My educational background is a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from Cal
          Poly, San Luis Obispo and a Masters in Engineering Management from
          Ohio University. This education served me well during my tenure as an
          Electronics Warfare Test Engineer at Edwards, AFB. And I am currently
          a Senior Engineer at Modern Technology Solutions, Inc. providing
          contract support to the Developmental and Operational Test Teams at
          the F-35 Joint Program Office.
